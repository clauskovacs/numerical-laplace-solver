# numerical_laplace

run with **python lp.py**

A video with the propagation of the algorithm will be created, as well as a plot of the electric field. Please note that the pictures using the plots will not be deleted automatically (see the folder -> gnuplot_figs).

Initial/Boundary-files are stored in the folder laplace_files. All values marked with a star are fix values and will not be changed from the program.
