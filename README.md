# numerical_laplace

run with **python lp.py**

A video of the propagation of the algorithm will be created, as well as a plot of the electric field. Please note that the pictures using the plots will not be deleted automatically (see the folder -> *gnuplot_figs*).

Initial/Boundary-files are stored in the folder laplace_files. All values marked with a star are fix values and will not be manipulated by the program.

The resulting (final) potential will be stored in the folder *pot_out*

The source code of the main file needs to be adapted if a different potential should be generated (see comments in the file)

One of the results can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzwLN4l16k4
